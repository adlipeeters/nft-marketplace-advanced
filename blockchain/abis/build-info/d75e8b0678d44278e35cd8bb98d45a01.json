Usage of {safeTransferFrom} prevents loss, though the caller must understand this adds an external call which potentially creates a reentrancy vulnerability. Requirements: - `from` cannot be the zero address. - `to` cannot be the zero address. - `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`. - If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}. Emits a {Transfer} event.\"}},\"title\":\"EIP-721 Metadata Update Extension\",\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC4906.sol\":\"IERC4906\"},\"evmVersion\":\"london\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd04b0f06e0666f29cf7cccc82894de541e19bb30a765b107b1e40bb7fe5f7d7a\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://7b652499d098e88d8d878374616bb58434301061cae2253298b3f374044e0ddb\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmbhAzctqo5jrSKU6idHdVyqfmzCcDbNUPvmx4GiXxfA6q\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC4906.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x2a9dadb806be80dd451821f1f1190eb9aa6f6edae85b185db29d60767cc0c5f4\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://5c25cac8dbe5bd96320053d23c3dacdb875e629d7c53ac00892eb7aa8500bde6\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmaf2oqbxxdJA9DphAoH4UCb8aXEAVM8fnu6qMxHJ5ta4A\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC721.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xaf297d12d8d4a57fe01a70f0ef38908f208e3faedc577056d0b728fa2f3ccf0c\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://fbfaf37123958822a2720a4ea29651be00edab787540b770f73d3e025d286ff8\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmbzgWeTm8hJVUqWrNAwFjshqbYVyeGpQA8D1huzxQdmw6\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x5bce51e11f7d194b79ea59fe00c9e8de9fa2c5530124960f29a24d4c740a3266\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://7e66dfde185df46104c11bc89d08fa0760737aa59a2b8546a656473d810a8ea4\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmXvyqtXPaPss2PD7eqPoSao5Szm2n6UMoiG8TZZDjmChR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x447a5f3ddc18419d41ff92b3773fb86471b1db25773e07f877f548918a185bf1\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://be161e54f24e5c6fae81a12db1a8ae87bc5ae1b0ddc805d82a1440a68455088f\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmP7C3CHdY9urF4dEMb9wmsp1wMxHF6nhA2yQE5SKiPAdy\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol":{"ReentrancyGuard":{"abi":[],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.11+commit.d7f03943\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Contract module that helps prevent reentrant calls to a function.
